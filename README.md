## About the Project

This is a command line team generator. It creates a team.html file that can be displayed in the browser. Anyone can use this to keep their employee information organized. When the application is running in Node.js the user is prompted to choose whether they would like to enter a manager, an intern or engineer. Depending on which role they choose additional questions are asked. Once an employee has been entered the user either has the option to enter another person or complete their entries. Once the user has entered everyone and selects "No I am Finished" a file called team.html will be created in the output folder. The webpage will display all the team members that have been entered in an organized fashion.
